# Test Lab for Parkster 2023

Welcome! We'll start off by watching the [Structure and Interpretation of Test Cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWn8RA_DEic) by Kevlin Henney.

Next it's time to try our newly aquired skillz on real code. Choose _any_ of the following code bases and write beautiful tests/specifications for them. If you have another idea of some code you want to test, feel free to use that instead.

1. Johan's [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/johanhaleby/spek2-lab) implementation (Note: Use JUnit 5 and not Spek!)
2. [Family Account](https://github.com/parkster-dev/core/blob/master/backend/web/core/src/main/java/se/parkster/bc/familyaccount/domain/FamilyAccount.java) (Try not to look at the existing test)
3. Johan's [DDD Tycoon](https://github.com/johanhaleby/ddd-tycoon) implementation
4. Your own DDD Tycoon implementation from last year
5. Your own Rock Paper Scissors implementation from the interview
