# Test Lab for Parkster 2023

Welcome! We'll start off by watching the [Structure and Interpretation of Test Cases](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWn8RA_DEic) by Kevlin Henney.

Next it's time to try our newly aquired skillz on real code. Choose any of the following code bases and write beautiful tests/specifications for them.

1. [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/johanhaleby/spek2-lab) (Note: Use JUnit 5 and not Spek!)
2. [Family Account](https://github.com/parkster-dev/core/blob/master/backend/web/core/src/main/java/se/parkster/bc/familyaccount/domain/FamilyAccount.java) (Try not to look at the existing test)
